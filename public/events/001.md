# UNAP Transport Carrier // 3.05.5014u

As the squad awakes from their month-long stasis and set their sights on the planet known as **HERCYNIA**, the drop carrier's captain notifies them to suit up - and make sure to borrow some EVA gear if they don't have any. The squad straps into one of a few dropships, and preps for the descent.

The squad is given a briefing packet from **UNION COMMAND** with the following sitrep:

1. Union’s imperative dictates that the squad treat the situation with utmost care. Hercynia is potentially populated by some sort of indigenous human culture, but the evidence is unclear.
2. The current holder of Hercynia’s charter is Landmark Colonial, a subsidiary of SmithShimano Corpro. The Squad is to make contact with Landmark’s representative on the ground first in order to present their credentials and integrate into the local hierarchy.
3. Hercynia was once subject to a widespread and catastrophic SecComm expeditionary campaign. The records lack detail, but building from what has been recovered from the old Union Colonial Mission indicates that the Second Committee mounted a handful of similar campaigns against resistant populations. This likely accounts for the massive amount of radiation, distress signals, encrypted comms, and general “noise” coming off the world. The squad should expect to encounter old Union military infrastructure in the form of unexploded ordinance, waste radiation, and possibly even abandoned ground-based installations.

The squad lands safely, dismounts from the shuttle, and begins assembling their gear as a small group approaches the shuttle. The group introduces themselves as a militia, with **BRAVA HADURA** as their Commander. She quickly informs them to get moving – and stay low, as there's a sniper in the area. The shuttle then begins its automated launch sequence, only to return a year from now.

The squad is escorted to **EVERGREEN** by the militia members. At a crossroads, the squad is warned that the street is a favorite of the sniper that has been plaguing the people of **EVERGREEN**, they are warned to move fast. While crossing the street, **??** and **PRINTLOAF** are narrowly missed by the sniper. 

After entering the colony, the squad was informed that it would be a few hours until **PATIENCE** can meet with them. In the meantime, the squad splits up and explore the colony. 

**??** and **RED** visit the **THE BOTTOM OF THE WELL**, meeting the proprietor, **MIR BAHADUR**, and becoming significantly intoxicated. **BAHADUR** asks **??** if she could provide some live combat footage for "entertainment" purposes.

**?** and **CURSED** visit the **MILITIA ARMORY**, where **BRAVA** asks the squad to provide combat footage showing the effective use of heavy ordinance for use as training material.

**???** and **PRINTLOAF** visit the **PRINT SHOP**, meeting chief engineer **CASTOR FIELDING**, who asks them to provide scan data on the raiders that have been harassing the colony, so that he and his team may calibrate weapons for the militia.

In the morning, the squad meets with **PATIENCE**, who grants them printer authorization and informs them of the colonies raider problem. The squad chooses to assist **FIELDING** with draining the colony's landing bowl.
